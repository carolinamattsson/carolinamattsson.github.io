# Hello!

I am a network scientist developing the analysis tools and modelling frameworks we need to study the economy as a complex system. Currently I work as a postdoc with the Computational Network Science group within LIACS at Leiden University, where I study the structure of production networks, real-world transaction data from payment systems, and temporal network representations. Aspects of my research are explicitly policy- or industry- facing, having participated in projects with the Dutch Ministry of Economics and Climate, Statistics Netherlands, International Monetary Fund, Microfinance Opportunities, and Telenor Research. Back in May 2020, I became one of the first to graduate from the innovative Network Science PhD program out of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. I have been an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, an NSF INTERN, and a member of the Lazer Lab advancing methods in computational social science.

*Need some Network/Data/Computational Social Science in your department? I expect to return to the job market in 2022*
