# Hello!

I am a network scientist developing the data, theory, and tools we need to study the economy as a complex system. Currently I work as a Researcher at CENTAI Institute in Turin, Italy. My published works include papers on transaction data from payment systems, the structure of production networks, and temporal network representations. Aspects of my research are explicitly policy- or industry- facing, having participated in projects with the Dutch Ministry of Economics and Climate, Statistics Netherlands, Microfinance Opportunities, the IFC (World Bank), and Telenor Research. My research has been funded via the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the NSF INTERN program, as well as grants by the World Bank and the Gates Foundation.
