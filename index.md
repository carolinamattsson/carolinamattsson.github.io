# Hello!

My aim is to understand economies from their own transaction records; developing the theory, data, and tools that we need to do so. Currently I work as a Researcher at CENTAI in Turin, Italy. I have published papers on transaction data from payment systems, the structure of production networks, and temporal network representations. Aspects of my research are explicitly policy- or industry- facing, having participated in projects with the Dutch Ministry of Economics and Climate, Statistics Netherlands, Microfinance Opportunities, the IFC, and Telenor Research. My research has been funded via the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the NSF INTERN program, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
