# Leadership

There is a budding research community at the intersection of network science, complexity economics, and computational social science. I believe there is tremendous scientific promise in this space, and that we can accelerate the growth of this community by inviting others to join in the fun.

### [Workshop on Economic and Financial Networks](https://sites.google.com/view/fineconets-netscix2020)
This workshop brings together researchers active in stuyding economic and financial networks from across disciplines and areas of the world to discuss state-of-the-art work, share practical knowledge, and create opportunities for novel and fruitful collaborations. I have been a member of the organizing team at the following editions:
* 2023 CCS (Salvador da Bahia)          
* 2023 NetSci (Vienna)          
* 2022 CCS (Mallorca)            
* 2020 NetSci-X (Tokyo)           
* 2019 NetSci (Burlington)        


### [INET YSI Complexity Economics Working Group](https://ysd.ineteconomics.org/workinggroup/complexity-economics)
Economies and societies are complex and evolving systems. The Complexity Economics Working Group provides a platform for students and early stage researchers to learn and discuss methodology and insights from complexity economics and related fields.

### [Society for Young Network Scientists](https://twitter.com/official_SYNS)
SYNS is a society of young network scientists, whether by age or experience. If you're an undergrad, master's, PhD, postdoc, or just a researcher new to Network Science, join us. You belong here.
