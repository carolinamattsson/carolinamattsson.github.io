# Research
As people and companies go about their business, they are leaving a treasure trove of data about the real economy---down at its most basic unit—on the servers of payment processing institutions worldwide. How individual transactions come together to create the economy as a whole is a compelling question worthy of both empirical and theoretical study.

### [Computational Network Science Lab](https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/)

The Leiden Computational Network Science Lab (CNS Lab) is a research group working on methods for knowledge discovery from real-world network data. We develop methods and algorithms to unveil patterns in dynamic complex networks from a range of application domains, including (online) social networks, scientific collaboration networks and economic networks. The CNS Lab is lead by Frank Takes and affiliated with the Theory and Data Science clusters of the Department of Computer Science (LIACS) of Leiden University.

### [Lazer Lab](https://lazerlab.net/)

The Lazer Lab advances methods in computational social science. I have contributed to several projects that aim to make digital trace and administrative data more useful to researchers.

### Consulting
Aspects of my research are explicitly policy- or industry- facing. I have participated in projects with the Dutch Ministry of Economics and Climate, Statistics Netherlands, International Monetary Fund, Microfinance Opportunities, and Telenor Research. The transformation for transaction data developed during my PhD is patent-pending.
