# Research

Taking the perspective that economies emerge out of many millions of transactions lets me ask compelling empirical and theoretical research questions. Most of my work follows from and contributes to this idea. I have also particpated in various projects as a part of various institutions. 

### Transaction records
People and companies leave a trail of transactions behind them as they go about their business. This means there is a treasure trove of data about the real economy sitting on the servers of payment processing institutions, worldwide. On the applied side, I develop methods and tools that facilitate the analysis of such datasets. On the theoretical side, currency systems are a compelling example with which to advance a theory of real-world walk process on networks.

### Firm-level production networks
Companies are especially similar to their close competitors, not to their trading partners. This has practical implications for the analysis of production networks and give us precise terms for the local structural features that may be key to understanding their routine function, failure, and growth. It also places production networks into the same ''category'' of network as protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, where our intutions from social networks can lead us astray.

### [Computational Network Science Lab](https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/)

The Leiden Computational Network Science Lab (CNS Lab) is a research group working on methods for knowledge discovery from real-world network data. We develop methods and algorithms to unveil patterns in dynamic complex networks from a range of application domains, including (online) social networks, scientific collaboration networks and economic networks. The CNS Lab is lead by Frank Takes and affiliated with the Theory and Data Science clusters of the Department of Computer Science (LIACS) of Leiden University.
