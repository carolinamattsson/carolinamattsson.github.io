# Research
People and companies leave a trail of transactions behind them as they go about their business. This means there is a treasure trove of data about the real economy sitting on the servers of payment processing institutions, worldwide. Taking the pserpective that the economy as a whole comes together out of many millions of transactions lets me ask compelling empirical and theoretical research questions. I have also participated in various other projects as a part of various research groups.

### [CENTAI](https://www.centai.eu/)

CENTAI is a newly established research institute located in Turin, Italy. The ambition of CENTAI is to push the boundaries of applied and foundational research in domains related to Artificial Intelligence and Complex System sciences.

### [Computational Network Science Lab](https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/)

The Leiden Computational Network Science Lab (CNS Lab) is a research group working on methods for knowledge discovery from real-world network data. We develop methods and algorithms to unveil patterns in dynamic complex networks from a range of application domains, including (online) social networks, scientific collaboration networks and economic networks. The CNS Lab is lead by Frank Takes and affiliated with the Theory and Data Science clusters of the Department of Computer Science (LIACS) of Leiden University.
